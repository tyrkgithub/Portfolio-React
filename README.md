# <h1>Week Three Challenge - Bootstrap Portfolio</h1>
  <br/>
 <h2>My Task</h2> 
   <p>This weeks challenge is recreating my portfolio web application using bootstrap.</p>
  
 <br/>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/tyrkgithub/bootstrap-portfolio/blob/main/README.md#link">Link</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/tyrkgithub/bootstrap-portfolio/blob/main/README.md#acceptance-criteria">User Story</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/tyrkgithub/bootstrap-portfolio/blob/main/README.md#resources">Resources</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/tyrkgithub/bootstrap-portfolio/blob/main/README.md#visual-references">Visual References</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/tyrkgithub/bootstrap-portfolio/blob/main/README.md#notes">Notes</a></li>
  
  </ul>
  <br/>
  
 <h2>Link</h2>
  
  <br/>
  
  <p> Please find the link to my deployed application <a href="https://tyrkgithub.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio">here.</a> </p>
  
  <br/>
  
 <h2>User Story</h2>
  
  <br/>
  
  <p>Bootstrap automatically detects screen size and adjust the content accordingly. Future employers will expect me to know how to use and edit bootstrap.<br/>
  </p>
  
  <br/>
  
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>

  <br/>
  
  <p>To achieve accessibility standards I need to ensure:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you</li>
    <li>When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section</li>
    <li>When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications</li>
    <li>When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others</li>
    <li>When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application</li>
    <li>When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport</li>
  </ul>
  
  <br/>

<h2>Resources</h2>

  <br/>
 
  <p>To complete this task I refered to the portfolio I made in week two. I then used code from getbootstrap.com for the nav and jumbotron, as well as from mdbootstrap.com for the footer<br/>
 <br/>
  
  <br/>

 <h2>Visual References</h2>
 
  <br/>

  <p>Below are screenshots of my portfolio and how the page looks on differnt size devices.</p>

 <h2>Notes</h2>


  <br/>
  
  <p>In this part of my READ.ME page I include things which helped me to complete the project.</p>
  
  <br/>
  
  <ul>
   <li>Mixing my own HTML code from the last challenge with bootstrap code meant when I used my previous CSS code, I had to change the class names to match the bootstrap class names</li>
   <li>Bootstrap code can have its own colour setting which you can override when you add your own CSS</li>
   <li>Instead inputting grid and flex in CSS, you can use Bootstrap cards which can be coded as a fraction of 12</li>
